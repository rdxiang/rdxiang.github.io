<s> Here's a post I'll eventually edit to sound like I'm a wise and wonderful blogger whose posts you'll love to read! So far so good!

So... I guess you're reading my blog! My name's Rachel and I'm currently a freshman at the University of Michigan (though there's much more to me than that!) I like trying weird foods (wasabi kit kats!) and using (way too many) parentheses and conjunctions.

I had been thinking of starting a blog for awhile now, but each time I dissuaded myself. ( "What do I know about programming anyway?") However, one day I stumbled upon a wonderful article via reddit on [why technical people should blog but don't](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/why-technical-people-should-blog-but-dont/). It inspired me to finally give it a go.

I realize that I'm not an expert on anything - and I'm perfectly okay with that. (We have to start somewhere, right?) This blog isn't for me to share my infinite wisdom, it's for me to share my thoughts as I try to figure things out. 

<small> That being said, please feel free to send me feedback, corrections, and/or suggestions!  I know I'll make mistakes and there's always room for improvement</small>
