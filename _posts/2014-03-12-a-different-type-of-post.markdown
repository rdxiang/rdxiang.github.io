<small> gasp! This isn't about programming? </small>



##Experiementing with Digital Art

I thought I'd write about something different today because, well, I like to do things other than programming! (And this way I can post like 5 pictures and pretend I've written a super long blog post in under 10 minutes!)

I've liked drawing for awhile, and recently I stumbled upon some of my old work on facebook graffiti from 8th - 10th grade. Here are a few examples of how I would find (masochistic?) joy spending 2-8+ hours clicking my mouse and trying to paint with ~ 60 colors and 1 brush.

 <small> Wow look at this long blog post that took me less than 10 minutes to write! </small>

Last week, I was able to borrow my friend's crazy awesome wacom tablet (!!). I can borrow it for the next few weeks, so I'm definitely going to <s>treat it like my first born child</s> make good use of it. In fact, I made a beeminder goal to draw ("artistic development") 3 times a week.

Drawing digitally definitely takes some getting used to! I'm using MyPaint (which is open source and availible for Linux!), and even thought it doesn't have as many features as other programs such as photoshop or corell paint, I'd definitely recommend it! Because it's relatively simple, it was a pretty easy transition from pencil and paper to tablet. Of course, I have yet to utilize all of the features (like the plethora of beautiful brushes) but I'm going to try to as I get more comfortable. I just used layers today, and I want to play around with more brushes next time.


Here's the resulting image (of a flamingo sleeping!)

With that, good night!
